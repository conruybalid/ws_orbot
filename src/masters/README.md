# Nodes

## master_node

This node is the main node that ties the other nodes together and performs the main logic of the system.
The main routine consists of
- going to the apple
- centering on the apple
- reaching for the apple
- grapping the apple
- disposing of the apple
Once it completes its task, it then destroys itself.

Arguments:
- --tank (moves the tank when no apples are found)
- --test (runs the test routine)
- --legacy (runs the legacy routine: one camera with red filter)
